# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security updates are applied only to the most recent release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have discovered a security vulnerability *within the bindings*, please report
it privately. **Do not disclose it as a public issue.** This gives us time to
work with you to fix the issue before public exposure, reducing the chance that
the exploit will be used before a patch is released.

Please disclose it at [technologies@riv-capital.com](mailto:technologies@riv-capital.com)

### Issues relating to RustCrypto
If you have discovered a security vulnerability within the Rust implementation, refer to RustCrypto's [security policy for signatures](https://github.com/RustCrypto/signatures/blob/master/SECURITY.md)
